*The **MTS Spartans App** is an app designed for the use of Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School students only, and is not for use by other people. As it might contain sensitive information that should only be viewed by the administrative staff, and students of MTS*

The MTS Spartans App is an app designed to help high school students from Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School stay organized and on top of important announcements and dates about their school.
 
This software updates students with the latest important calendar dates (Civvies days, Math Help days, School Sports Events, Test Days), and latest announcements (Extracurricular Activities, Graduation Preparation) published by the school giving students more information about what is happening at their school. 
This results in students managing their time better, a stronger student-teacher connection, students never missing important announcements or events, and overall a better, stronger Spartans community.
